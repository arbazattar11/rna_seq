# RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline

Welcome to the RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline repository! This repository contains a linux script for performing RNA-seq data analysis. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique used to measure the expression of genes in a biological sample. This pipeline takes RNA-seq expression data as input, preprocesses it and visualizes the results.

## Introduction

RNA-seq has become a standard tool for studying gene expression due to its high-throughput nature and ability to quantify transcript levels accurately. However, analyzing RNA-seq data can be complex and requires a series of computational steps to extract meaningful insights.

This pipeline aims to simplify the RNA-seq analysis process by providing a modular and user-friendly linux script. Users can easily adapt this script to their specific datasets and research questions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and log-transform the expression data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the script to incorporate additional analysis steps or adapt it to different experimental designs.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize the results and explore the underlying structure of the data.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`.
2. **Prepare Data**: Prepare your RNA-seq expression data in tabular format.
3. **Run the Script**: Update the file path in the script to point to your data file and execute `python rna_seq_analysis.py`.
4. **Explore Results**: Explore the generated plots to gain insights into the structure of your RNA-seq data.
